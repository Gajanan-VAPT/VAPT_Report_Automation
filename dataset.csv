  - urllib3 before 1.25.9 allows CRLF injection if the attacker controls the HTTP request method, as     demonstrated by inserting CR and LF control characters in the first argument of putrequest(). NOTE: this     is similar to CVE-2020-26116. (CVE-2020-26137)

  - http.client in Python 3.x before 3.5.10, 3.6.x before 3.6.12, 3.7.x before 3.7.9, and 3.8.x before 3.8.5     allows CRLF injection if the attacker controls the HTTP request method, as demonstrated by inserting CR     and LF control characters in the first argument of HTTPConnection.request. (CVE-2020-26116)

  - Python 3.x through 3.9.1 has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c, which may lead to     remote code execution in certain Python applications that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted     input, as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to c_double.from_param. This occurs because sprintf is used     unsafely. (CVE-2021-3177)

  - Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP syslog reception have a potential heap     buffer overflow when octet-counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other     malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be used for remote code execution. But     there may still be a slight chance for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read.
    While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are written to a heap buffer even when the     octet count is over the maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once the sequence     of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote     exploits impossible or at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential framing     modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`,     `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to     directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed, the risk is considerably lower. Module     `imdiag` is a diagnostics module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to be present     on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is not very common. Usually, it needs to be     specifically enabled at senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most important     modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability. (CVE-2022-24903)

Bug Fix(es) :

* Previously, the mysqladmin tool waited for an inadequate length of time if the socket it listened on did not respond in a specific way.
Consequently, when the socket was used while the MariaDB server was starting, the mariadb service became unresponsive for a long time.
With this update, the mysqladmin timeout has been shortened to 2 seconds. As a result, the mariadb service either starts or fails but no longer hangs in the described situation. (BZ#1584023)",Update the affected mariadb packages.,https://oss.oracle.com/pipermail/el-errata/2018-August/007941.html,"

  - In ISC DHCP 4.1-ESV-R1 -> 4.1-ESV-R16, ISC DHCP 4.4.0 -> 4.4.2 (Other branches of ISC DHCP (i.e., releases     in the 4.0.x series or lower and releases in the 4.3.x series) are beyond their End-of-Life (EOL) and no     longer supported by ISC. From inspection it is clear that the defect is also present in releases from     those series, but they have not been officially tested for the vulnerability), The outcome of encountering     the defect while reading a lease that will trigger it varies, according to: the component being affected     (i.e., dhclient or dhcpd) whether the package was built as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary whether the compiler     flag -fstack-protection-strong was used when compiling In dhclient, ISC has not successfully reproduced     the error on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bit system it is possible to cause dhclient to crash when     reading an improper lease, which could cause network connectivity problems for an affected system due to     the absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, when run in DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd     server binary was built for a 32-bit architecture AND the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified to     the compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing a lease file containing an objectionable lease, resulting in     lack of service to clients. Additionally, the offending lease and the lease immediately following it in     the lease database may be improperly deleted. if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 64-bit     architecture OR if the -fstack-protection-strong compiler flag was NOT specified, the crash will not     occur, but it is possible for the offending lease and the lease which immediately followed it to be     improperly deleted.

  - An issue was discovered in rsync before 3.2.5 that allows malicious remote servers to write arbitrary     files inside the directories of connecting peers.

  - There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName.
    X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME     incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently     interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL     checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may     allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or     enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate     chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these     inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is     uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented     their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network. (CVE-2023-0286)

An update for libvirt is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

The libvirt library contains a C API for managing and interacting with the virtualization capabilities of Linux and other operating systems.
In addition, libvirt provides tools for remote management of virtualized systems.

Security Fix(es) :

* An industry-wide issue was found in the way many modern microprocessor designs have implemented speculative execution of Load & Store instructions (a commonly used performance optimization). It relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code as well as the fact that memory read from address to which a recent memory write has occurred may see an older value and subsequently cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire). As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read privileged memory by conducting targeted cache side-channel attacks. (CVE-2018-3639)

Note: This is the libvirt side of the CVE-2018-3639 mitigation that includes support for guests running on hosts with AMD processors.

Red Hat would like to thank Ken Johnson (Microsoft Security Response Center) and Jann Horn (Google Project Zero) for reporting this issue.

Bug Fix(es) :

* Previously, the virtlogd service logged redundant AVC denial errors when a guest virtual machine was started. With this update, the virtlogd service no longer attempts to send shutdown inhibition calls to systemd, which prevents the described errors from occurring.
(BZ#1573268)

* Prior to this update, guest virtual machine actions that use a python library in some cases failed and 'Hash operation not allowed during iteration' error messages were logged. Several redundant thread access checks have been removed, and the problem no longer occurs.
(BZ#1581364)

* The 'virsh capabilities' command previously displayed an inaccurate number of 4 KiB memory pages on systems with very large amounts of memory. This update optimizes the memory diagnostic mechanism to ensure memory page numbers are displayed correctly on such systems.

An update for systemd is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit.

Security Fix(es) :

* systemd: Insufficient input validation in bus_process_object() resulting in PID 1 crash (CVE-2019-6454)
